# EV Analysis Dashboard


## Overview
This project entails creating an interactive dashboard in Tableau named "EV Analysis." The dashboard visualizes various aspects of electric vehicle (EV) data, including vehicle distribution, ownership, and type. The dataset used in this project was a CSV file containing information about EVs such as Id, location details, model year, make, model, electric range, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset was a CSV file with the following columns:
- Id
- County
- City
- State
- Postal Code
- Model Year
- Make
- Model
- Electric Vehicle Type
- Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility
- Electric Range
- Base MSRP
- Legislative District
- DOL Vehicle ID
- Vehicle Location
- Electric Utility
- 2020 Census Tract



## Usage
- Open the Tableau workbook (`.twbx` file).
- Interact with the various visualizations to explore the data.
- Use the filters and parameters to customize the views.

## Conclusion
The EV Analysis Dashboard provides valuable insights into the distribution and characteristics of electric vehicles across different regions. By leveraging Tableau's powerful visualization tools, we can explore trends and patterns in EV ownership, helping stakeholders make informed decisions. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of data visualization in making complex data more accessible and understandable.
